# ORCHESTRIX – Intelligent Warehouse Orchestration Platform

---

## Slide 1: Title

**ORCHESTRIX**
Intelligent Warehouse Orchestration Platform

Software-Only | Multi-Robot Coordination | Real-Time Replanning

---

## Slide 2: Overview

ORCHESTRIX is a software-based warehouse orchestration platform.

* Manages a fleet of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)
* Bridges business-level planning (WMS) and robot-level execution (RCS)
* Designed for dynamic, real-world warehouse environments

---

## Slide 3: Problem We Solve

### Problem

* Multiple robots operating simultaneously
* Dynamic obstacles appear unexpectedly
* Risk of collisions and deadlocks
* Hardware-based testing is costly and slow

### Solution

* Intelligent task orchestration
* Dynamic path planning and re-planning
* Software-only simulation for rapid testing

---

## Slide 4: System Architecture

### 3-Layer Industrial Architecture

**WMS – Business Brain**

* Generates warehouse tasks
* Manages inventory and orders

**WCS – Traffic Controller**

* Assigns tasks to optimal robots
* Monitors fleet status

**RCS – Robot Driver**

* Calculates paths
* Controls movement and obstacle avoidance

---

## Slide 5: Core Intelligence

### Algorithms Used

**A* Pathfinding**

* Optimal shortest-path algorithm
* Grid-based navigation
* Manhattan distance heuristic

**Dynamic Re-Planning**

* Detects sudden obstacles
* Safely pauses robot movement
* Recomputes path in real time

---

## Slide 6: Dynamic Environment Handling

### Real-Time Adaptation

* Robots validate the next cell before moving
* Blocked path triggers an immediate stop
* New path calculated from the current position
* No collision and no system halt

**Result:** Safe and efficient navigation in live environments

---

## Slide 7: Technology Stack

### Backend

* Python 3.12+
* FastAPI (asynchronous and high performance)
* Modular architecture (WMS, WCS, RCS)

### Frontend

* React 18 (Vite)
* Manual CSS (no Tailwind or UI frameworks)
* Custom grid-based visualization

---

## Slide 8: Platform Capabilities

### Key Features

* Multi-robot task orchestration
* Intelligent task assignment
* Live robot tracking
* Dynamic obstacle simulation
* Real-time path re-planning

---

## Slide 9: User Interaction

### How Users Interact

* Dispatch tasks using the operations panel
* Add or remove robots dynamically
* Place obstacles by interacting with the map
* Reset or randomize the warehouse layout
* Observe live robot behavior

---

## Slide 10: Why Software-Only?

### Industry Insight

* Majority of automation logic is developed before hardware integration
* Enables faster iteration and safer testing
* Mirrors real-world WCS and RCS development workflows

ORCHESTRIX focuses on orchestration logic rather than hardware dependencies.

---

## Slide 11: Key Highlights

* Real-world warehouse modeling
* Intelligent multi-agent coordination
* Dynamic path re-planning
* Clean and modular architecture
* Suitable for both hackathons and industry demonstrations

---

## Slide 12: Final Statement

ORCHESTRIX demonstrates how modern warehouse automation systems coordinate multiple robots intelligently in dynamic environments using software-only orchestration.
